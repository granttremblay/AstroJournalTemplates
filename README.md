## Grant's (minor) changes to AASTeX and mn2e

In general, I _really_ like the new `AASTeX v6.1`, whose original version is [http://journals.aas.org/authors/aastex.html](available here). I've made a few modifications to their `hyperref` implementation, the philosophy behind which can be [http://www.astrobetter.com/blog/2014/09/29/latex-hyperref-and-emulateapj/](found here). 

I'll add my _Nature_ and MNRAS templates later.
